Assignment Number: Lab 13

This lab was a test of file |/O. It tested creating, reading, and manipulation of files.

The first method creates a file. This file creates a list of 10-20 Names with a random
number between 1-10 next to the names with a space in between the name and number. The
names used are random from a predefined array.

The second method reads a file and prints the contents as line-delimited. This means
that the Scanner reads the file elements by reading characters up to the end of a line.
It then takes the element and prints it into the command line, breaks to the next line,
and continues to read and break until there are no more elements to read.

The third method re-writes files of this lab's format and takes the square of the numbers
on the lines and re-writes over the old number. To accomplish this, the program reads
the file to determine how many lines it has (because the line amount depends on the 
random generation in method 1). With this, the program stores the names and numbers
of the file. From there, the Formatter writes to the file of the same name and uses 
the data read from the old version of the file to re-write the names and write the 
old numbers' squares.

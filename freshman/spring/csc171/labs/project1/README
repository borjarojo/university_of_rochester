This project consisted of two class types being created and tested, Rational and Complex numbers.
Each class called upon 2 variants of the four arithmetic operator methods, on Static and one 
Dynamic. My approach was simple: use the steps I learned in basic algebra to perform these
operations systematically. This way, a computer can replicate each step. Most specifics are
details within the program with my comments. The static and dynamic methods do the job asked by
the project, but both use the same approach in systematic calculation.

Each class also had two different methods that are useful when dealing with Rational or Complex numbers.
The Rational class has an equals and compareTo method. They are BOTH dynamic methods. The difference is
that the compareTo method returns a 1 or a -1 depending if the two compare Rationals are equal or not,
respectively. The equals method does the same but returns true of false for equals or not equals, respectively.
The Complex class lets you calculate the radius and angle of the complex number as if it were plotted on a 
2-D plain. These two methods are static. The radius method uses the Pythagorian theorum and returns a double
representative of length. The angle method uses the tan() method and returns a double.

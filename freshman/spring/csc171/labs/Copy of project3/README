	This assignment was to make a retirement calculator that has many fields where you can enter information.  The information
is scanned and used to make a graph that is in the Frame and automatically updates when the fields change.  The graph has x-axis numbers
that correlate to the age you will be at.  And the graph rescales at certain limits, unfortunately, it does not scale to the top
all the time.

	I used a series of JTextFields that were listened using a document listener, and the information was relayed using some getters
and setters to my paint component.  Then in my paint component many methods were called to use the correct math to find the yearly worth.
I then created an object "bar" that took in 4 ints, and a color.  Which would correlate to the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, height,
and the color of the bar.  If the bar is positive, it is green, if it is negative, it is red.


I did not use any major online resources, besides basic syntax of Document Listeners.  I know many other students used code to make a graph
from one of the TAs, I created my own.

Assignment Number: Lab 9

This lab has an emphasis on methods. It asked me to write many types of methods.
I wrote static methods because none of the methods altered any global values. 
The method used to print my name and address was a void method because it did
not return any values. The other, more mathimatical, methods returned many
different types of values, such as ints, doubles, and longs. I also used methods
within methods, such as the cubed method using the square method and the larger 
max methods using the two-int max method ealier. I also overloaded three of my
methods, max, square, and cube, so that I could have different data-types or
different amounts of data bring entered.

I wrote this in Eclipse. You can run it there in if you add [package lab9;]
to the top. Other then that, it's java.

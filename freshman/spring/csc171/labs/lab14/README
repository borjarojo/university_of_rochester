This lab tested the RegEx concepts to check strings. This proves to be 
useful for gathering information from people in a survey type situation.
This lab had me take the first name, last name, address, city, state,
zip-code, and email address of the user. These pieces of information had
to be entered in a certain format which then needed to be evaluated using
matches() and RegEx in order to varify the format. The trickiest piece of
information was evaluating the email addresses for dots at the begining
and end of the username. I solved this problem by using methods to find
the location of the @ symbol in the string and checking to make sure 
the character before the @ symbol wasn't a dot. It was much simpler to 
check that the first character was not an @ symbol.

This code has not packages, so it should work in the command line.

I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO MAKE MY JAR FILES WORK. I have not found ANYTHING that
can help explain what my problem is. My code works in Eclipse and compiles 
on Terminal, but it does not make a working Jar file.

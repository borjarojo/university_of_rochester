Assignment Number: Lab 6

This lab had 4 parts to it. The first asked me to write a for-loop
that incremented distance based on speed an time. I did not know how
to code the second part specifically. I would create a class that extends
JFrame and use the Graphics class to display the circles. The circles
placement and size would have to do with how many were requested.
The third part asked me to print diamonds
depending on an input line count. The fourth question asked me to 
print the lyrics to "The twelve days of Christmas" using switch
statements.

This was written in Eclipse.

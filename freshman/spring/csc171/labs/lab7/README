Assignment Number: Lab 7

The objective of Lab 7 was to draw a picture using a JFrame and JPanel.
I used the setColor method in the Graphics class to set colors of 
different shapes I drew. I used the drawOval method to draw circles
for the body, buttons, and eyes of the snowman. I used drawLine to draw
the arms of the arms. I used fillPolygon to draw a triangle for the 
nose. I used fillArc to draw the mouth of the snowman. I used drawString
to make the snowman talk. I used fillRect to make the background blue.

This was written in Eclipse. Use Eclipse to run this program.

In the first program, I evaluated a set of positive numbers entered 
by the user.I gave out the maximum, minimum, and average of the number 
set. I used a while loop to check whether or not to continue the loop
if a negative number was entered. I also used an if statement to determine
whether an enter should be evaluated or not, depending on if the number
was postive or negative.

In the second program, I evaluated factorial operations using two 
different data-types. Using a for-loop to run a factorial calculation,
I evaluated factorial for the long data-type and the int data-type.

In the third program, I drew a Cartesian plane that is 20x20 units
tall and wide. I drew the plane using a for-loop for 20 iterations
that created evenly spaced lines across the plane.

In the fourth program, I altered the third program to make space for
label on the x and y axis. I adjusted the ratio of each line being printed
and adaquately printed the labels.

This was written in Eclipse. Use Eclipse to run this program.

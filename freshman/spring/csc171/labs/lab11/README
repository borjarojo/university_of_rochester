Assignment Number: Lab 11

The results of the first half show the original array printed (first half of 5) 
and then the altered arrays (second half of 5). The altered arrays show that 
when the original array was altered, so was the aliased array while the copied 
array was not affected. This is due to the was arrays are stored and called upon.
When an element of an array is addressed or is used, the actually memory of the
array element is being used. This means that any function on that array or array
element will affect the ACTUAL original array. This is reflected in the results 
because the aliased array is a pointer to the original array, so when the original
is altered, so is the aliased array. The second array is NOT affected because the
array it was assigned to was an actual copy, where elements of the original array
were copied into the memory spaces, as opposed to becoming pointers to previously
defined memory locations.

The second part of the assignment was a 2D array manipulation program. It has methods
to print 2D arrays in CSV format for both String 2D arrays and int 2D arrays. It also
has a method to create a random 2D array with elements between 0 and the product of 
the row and column count. For the methods, I used nested for-loops to systematically 
go through each row and column element, depending on the row amount and column amount 
of each respective row. that means that if a row element does not have the same amount
of column elements as other rows, the method will compensate for that.

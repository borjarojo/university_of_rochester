NOTE:
Playing against the computer will only allow you to play as X because Tic Tac Toe is a solved game

This assignment was very difficult. Most of the issues that went into programming this
program had to do with my lack of knowledge in the Java language. It was hard to put 
together the JPanels because I did not understand how the different layouts and possible
components could be used. After I understood that, it was not too difficult to make the
layout. Another challenge was using the JButtons. I had to understand how to read an
input from the JButtons. Once I understood how ActionListener worked, then I was able 
to use it well. Another Challenge I had was making the game save the scores. I was not
sure what to do for the exceptions. I was told that I just needed to include the default
try-catch block and to not worry about the rest, so I did that, and it works fine now.
Programming the AI was very difficult. I was told to look up algorithims, but because
this is my first year programming, I had no idea how to program what I was reading, so]
I did a large if-else decision tree.

This project wasn't too difficult when it came to making the game work. The project was 
incredibly difficult when it came down to coding what was in my head. The problem 
solving was tough, but the coding was.

The way to run the program is to run the JAR file, or to import the ZIP file into 
Eclipse and run it there. there is no packaging on this file, so it should run in the
compiler.

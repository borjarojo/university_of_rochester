                    <h2>Early life</h2>
                    <p>Ma was born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. His parents are traditional musician-storytellers. At an early age, Ma developed a desire to learn English so he rode his bike each morning in order to go to a nearby hotel and converse with foreigners. He would guide them around the city for free in order to practice and improve his English.</p>
                    <p>Later in his youth and although he failed the university entrance exam three times, Ma attended Hangzhou Teacher's Institute (currently known as Hangzhou Normal University) and graduated in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in English. While at school, Ma was elected student chairman. He later became a lecturer in English and International Trade at the Hangzhou Dianzi University. He later went on to attend further education at Beijing-based Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business (CKGSB), founded in 2002 by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, graduating in 2006.</p>
                    <p>First he started building websites for Chinese companies with the help of friends in the US. He has said that "the day we got connected to the Web, I invited friends and TV people over to my house," and on a very slow dial-up connection, "we waited three and a half hours and got half a page.... We drank, watched TV and played cards, waiting. But I was so proud. I proved (to my house guests that) the Internet existed."</p>
                    <p>At a conference in 2010, Ma revealed that he has never actually written a line of code nor made one sale to a customer. He encountered a computer for the first time at the age of thirty-three.</p>

                    <h2>Career</h2>
                    <p>In 1994, Ma heard about the Internet. In early 1995, he went to the United States occasionally, and with his friend's help he got introduced to the Internet. In April 1995, Ma, his wife and a friend collected twenty thousand dollars and started an Internet company. Their company was dedicated to creating website for companies. He named their company "China Yellow Pages." Within three years, his company had made ¥5,000,000 Chinese Yuan which was equivalent to $800,000 US dollars at the time.</p>
                    <p>From 1998 to 1999, Ma headed an information technology company established by the China International Electronic Commerce Center, a department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. In 1999, he decided to quit his job and went back to Hangzhou with his team in order to found Alibaba in his apartment with a group of 17 friends. He started a new round of venture development with 500,000 Yuan. Alibaba is a China-based business-to-business marketplace site which currently serves more than 79 million members from more than 240 countries and territories.</p>
                    <p>In October 1999 and January 2000, "Alibaba" won twice total of a $25 million international venture capital investment. The program was expected to improve the domestic e-commerce market, and build a perfect e-commerce platform for those Chinese enterprises especially SMEs, to meet the "WTO" challenge. Ma wanted to improve the entire e-commerce system, and since 2003, he founded Taobao, Alipay, Ali Mama, and lynx etc. After the rapid rise of Taobao, eBay offered to purchase Taobao, but Ma rejected. Ma got support from Yahoo’s co-founder Jerry Yang with a $1 billion investment.</p>
                    <p>In September 2014 it was reported Alibaba was raising over $20 billion in an IPO at NYSE. Alibaba became one of the most valuable tech companies in the world after raising $25 billion from the IPO. Ma now serves as Executive Chairman of Alibaba Group, which is a holding company with nine major subsidiaries – Alibaba.com, Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, eTao, Alibaba Cloud Computing, Juhuasuan, 1688.com, AliExpress.com and Alipay. In November 2012, Alibaba's online transaction volume exceeded one trillion yuan. Ma was thus labeled "trillion Hou", meaning literally "Trillion Yuan Marquis" in Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Because of Ma’s success, Ma was often invited to lectures at world’s famous universities, such as the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and Peking University.</p>

                    <h2>Two online shopping webs by Jack Ma</h2>
                    <h3>Alibaba</h3>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Alibaba.com, the primary company of Alibaba, is the world’s largest online business-to-business trading platform for small businesses. Founded in Hangzhou in eastern China, Alibaba.com has three main services. The company’s English language portal Alibaba.com handles sales between importers and exporters from more than 240 countries and regions. The Chinese portal 1688.com was developed for domestic business-to-business trade in China. In addition, Alibaba.com offers a transaction-based retail website, AliExpress.com, which allows smaller buyers to buy small quantities of goods at wholesale prices.</p>
                    <p>Alibaba.com went public at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2007, and was delisted again in 2012.</p>
                    <p>In 2013, 1688.com launched a direct channel that is responsible for $30 million in daily transaction value.</p>
                    <h3>Taobao</h3>
                    <figure class="tb">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Taobao Marketplace, or Taobao, is China's largest consumer-to-consumer online shopping platform. Founded in 2003, it offers a variety of products for retail sale. In January 2015 it was the second most visited web site in China, according to Alexa.com. Taobao's growth was attributed to offering free registration and commission-free transactions using a free third-party payment platform.</p>
                    <p>Advertising makes up 85 percent of the company's total revenue, allowing it to break even in 2009. Taobao's 2010 profit was estimated to be 1.5 billion yuan (US $235.7 million), only about 0.4 percent of their total sales figure of 400 billion yuan (US $62.9 billion) that year, way below the industry average of 2 percent, according to iResearch estimates.</p>
                    <p>According to Zhang Yu, the director of Taobao, the number of stores on Taobao with annual sales under 100 thousand yuan increased by 60% between 2011 and 2013. Over the same period, the number of stores with sales between 10 thousand and 1 million yuan increased by 30%, and the number of stores with sales over 1 million yuan increased by 33%. Taobao's total sales (including Tmall) exceeded 1 trillion yuan (USD 160 billion) in 2012. And on 11 November 2012, the biggest online shopping promotion activity, Taobao accomplished 19.1 billion yuan (USD 3.07 billion) sales in one day.</p>

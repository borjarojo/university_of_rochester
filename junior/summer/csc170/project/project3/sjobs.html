					</figure>

					<p>Steven Paul "Steve" Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011)was an American entrepreneur,marketer,and inventor, who was the cofounder, chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc.</p>

					<p>Through Apple, he was widely recognized as a charismatic and design-driven pioneer of the personal computer revolution and for his influential career in the computer and consumer electronics fields, transforming "one industry after another, from computers and smartphones to music and movies."</p>

					<p>Jobs also funded what would become Pixar Animation Studios; he became a member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company in 2006, when Disney acquired Pixar. Jobs was among the first to see the commercial potential of Xerox PARC's mouse-driven graphical user interface, which led to the creation of the Apple Lisa and a year later, the original Macintosh. He played a role in introducing the LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics that started desktop publishing to the market.</p>

					<p>In 1996, after Apple had failed to deliver its operating system, Copland, Gil Amelio turned to NeXT, and the NeXTSTEP platform became the foundation for Mac OS X.Jobs returned to Apple as an advisor, and took control of the company as an interim CEO. Jobs brought Apple from near bankruptcy to profitability by 1998.</p>

					<p>As the new CEO of the company, Jobs oversaw the development of the iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, and on the services side, the company's Apple Stores, the iTunes Store, and the App Store.The success of these products and services provided several years of stable financial returns, and propelled Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in 2011.</p>

					<p>n 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreas neuroendocrine tumor. Though it was initially treated, he reported a hormone imbalance, underwent a liver transplant in 2009, and appeared progressively thinner as his health declined.On medical leave for most of 2011, Jobs resigned in August that year, and was elected Chairman of the Board. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor on October 5, 2011.</p>

				<h2 id="life">Early Life</h2>

					<h3>Family</h3>
						<p>Jobs was born in San Francisco, California on February 24, 1955.Schieble, his birth mom, wanted Jobs to only be adopted by college graduates. When Schieble learned that Clara Jobs had not graduated from college and Paul Jobs had only attended high school, she initially refused the adoption. She later signed the final adoption papers only after Paul and Clara promised her that the child would attend college.[Jobs would later become upset when Paul and Clara were referred to as "adoptive parents," stating instead that <strong>they "were my parents 1,000%."</strong> </p>

						<p>Then, the family moved to Mountain View, California.Paul worked as a mechanic and a carpenter, and taught his son rudimentary electronics and how to work with his hands.Paul showed Steve how to work on electronics in the family garage, demonstrating to his son how to take apart and rebuild electronics such as radios and televisions. As a result, he became interested in and developed a hobby of technical tinkering.</p>

					<h3>College Time</h3>
						<p>Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Reed was an expensive college which Paul and Clara could ill afford. They were spending much of their life savings on their son's higher education.</p>

						<p> In a 2005 commencement speech for Stanford University, Jobs states that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple.In that same speech, Jobs said: "If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts."</p>

					<p>Apple Inc., formerly Apple Computer, Inc., is a multinational corporation that creates consumer electronics, personal computers, computer software, and commercial servers, and is a digital distributor of media content. The company also has a chain of retail stores known as Apple Stores.</p>

					<p>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had withdrawn from Reed College and UC Berkeley, respectively by 1975. Wozniak designed a video terminal that he could use to log on to the minicomputers at Call Computer. Alex Kamradt commissioned the design and sold a small number of them through his firm. Aside from their interest in up-to-date technology, the impetus for "the two Steves" seems to have had another source. </p>

					<p>Wozniak completed the machine and took it to Homebrew Computer Club meetings to show it off. At the meeting, Wozniak met his old friend Jobs, who was interested in the commercial potential of the small hobby machines.</p>

					<p>They began their partnership when Wozniak, a talented, self-educated electronics engineer, began constructing boxes which enabled one to make long-distance phone calls at no cost, and sold several hundred models.Later, Jobs managed to interest Wozniak in assembling a computer machine and selling it.</p>

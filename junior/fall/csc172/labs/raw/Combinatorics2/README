MainTest.java holds all my methods to the Combinatorics 2 lab

The first method I created is the bigIntFact() method, which 
recursively computes the factorial of a given BigInteger. This
was extremely useful when designing recursive steps for the other
methods as I did not have to worry about including the factorial
within the recursion.

The second method I wrote is the orderIdItem(), which returns how many
distinct ways you can order a group of items that has multiple
indistinguishable items in that group. The recursive process of this method
was to check and see if 1. the last item to be multiplied was reached
2. check if it was the first pass through and begin the recursion or
3. apply the recursive step by iterating through the i groups. Details
can be seen in the comments of my code.

The third method I wrote is the distIndObjToBin(), which returns how many
ways a group of indistinguishable items can be sorted into a number of
bins. This method was asked to be written recursively, which isn't exactly
the case with my method. I only used one return line because I had already
written a method to compute factorials recursively. This method, although it
may not look like it, still has recursive algorithms in it. I hope this is
sufficient, as I wouldn't know another, less tedious way to code this method.
Unlike my second and fourth methods, there isn't any sequence element to this
computation.

The fourth method I wrote is the distDisObjToBin(), which returns how many
ways a group of objects with sets of distinguishable objects within can be
sorted into a group of bins. Like my second method, This was made recurively
by first checking for the base case, which is whether or not the end of the
series was reached. Then, checking to see if it was the start of the method,
which begins by dividing the top by the bottom, where the bottom is the (m-1)!
multiplied by the recursive step. Lastly, the recursive step would be reached,
which is mulitplying the factorials of the different distinguishable group
sizes.

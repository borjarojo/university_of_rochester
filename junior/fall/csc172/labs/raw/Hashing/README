Lab 17 Hashing

Partner: Daniel Saltz

This lab was a an exercise in creating your own Hash table. First, a hash value 
function was created using good strategies. Then insertion with linear probing 
was used as the method for adding elements to the hash table. Insertion can
only insert keys that are already not present. If the table has a load factor
of more than 50%, then the table is expanded using rehashing. Rehashing is a
proceedure where a new, larger table is built and then all the elements in the
old hash table are inserted, or "rehashed", into the new table, larger table,
This is used for run time efficiency.

Then, the table was tested on a large number of values using the Lorem Ipsum
pregenerated words. Ten paragraphs of words were then hashed into a hash table.

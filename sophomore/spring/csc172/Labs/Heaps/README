This lab was an exersize in implementing the Heap data structure.
The main challenges were implementing the idea of bubbleUp and bubbleDown.
These two methods are pinnacle as every data structure modeled after a heap
has these two properties. The insert method has an expand method used to
expand a heap when needed, and then used bubbleUp to correct itself. 
The deleteMin returned the minimum value in my heap, which is the starting
item, and used the bubbleDown method to reorganize the heap.

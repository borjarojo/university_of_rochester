Java Files: Edge.java, Graph.java, MainClass.java, Vertex.java
Test Files: 9.10.txt, 9.17.txt, 9.62.txt, test1.txt, test2.txt, test3.txt

Edge.java holds the code that defines and edge in my graph. It holds two
ints and is directed.

Graph.java holds the code that defines my graph. It has an adjacency list
and a Vertex array. It also can be either directed or undirected.

Vertex.java is a small class that defines my vertex to allow my mark data
as the program works on the graph.

MainClass.java is my main class that handles reading and executing the
required methods.

This project was an exercize in finding the shortest path from a specified
to any other node. This was done by reading a file that held a form to create
a graph. Then, a vertex was chosen to begin the path mapping. Then, the 
program ran an algorithm to sort the graph accordingly. Then, the another
point is chosen to check what the shortest path it that goes from the starting
point to the chosen point.

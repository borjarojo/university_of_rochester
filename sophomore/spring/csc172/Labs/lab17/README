Lab17.java is my whole class for this lab

This lab was an exercise in using the java supported HashMap class. This lab called
for the reading of a file that held zipcodes, cities, and states in a comma delimitted
format, and entering those cities into a hash map with thier zipcodes as their keys.
Then, that hashmap was used to generate a new hashmap that held the amount of zipcodes
a city has, with the amount as the data and the city as the key. Scanner was used for 
reading the file.

This lab was also instructed to make a loop to be able to lookup the cities with a 
their zipcodes and number of zipcodes a city has with that city. The computer queries.
then it decides if the input is valid through regex for the zipcode keys and containsKey()
for the city keys. Scaner was used to user input.

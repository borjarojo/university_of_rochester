This lab was about constructing a Binary Search Tree class with many methods that
pertain to the BST. This includes insertion, deletion, lookup, and three different kinds of 
printing. The insertion method inserts data that is not already there, meaning it checks
to see if the lookup is true for the data being inserted before it is inserted. The
deletion implements 3 different strategies to delete a node as 3 different kinds of nodes
exist. A leaf node only required that it's parent no longer points to it. A single child
node requires analysis of it's surrounding branches and uses that to properly cut 
itself out of the tree. The double child node deletion is quite a bit more involved
as it requires data replacement out the leftmost child of the nodes right child and 
deletion of the leftmost child of the right child. The print methods are of three types:
Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder. The difference between the three is when the printing
of the data is done when searching through a tree. The methods implemented are left-to-right
oriented.

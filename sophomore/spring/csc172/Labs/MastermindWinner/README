The Mastermind.java file holds the code for this project
and the README and OUTPUT files contain information on the
project.

This project was an exercise in creating a program 
to be able to solve any Mastermind riddle. Process 
of elimination was the technique used in order to
narrow down the possible solutions.

The algorithm I used was very simple. The computer queried the
user to know how many tiles are in the right place.
Then, I went through every possible combination of
tiles and marked which ones did not fit the discription.
The computer continues to queried the user until it has 
all of its possibilities eliminated.

The technique of implementing this algorithm was keeping a
2D array of all possible combinations, where the rows held
all possible combinations for the set of tiles and spaces
given. Then, another boolean array was created in tandem
with the possibilities array that held a true or false value
whose indexes corresponded with the columns of the 
possibilities array. With these two keys, checking to see
if a guess by the computer was correct only required some
querying, and checking and updating the possibilities array
and the boolean array.

The method used in creating the possibilities array was,
by using the basic information gathered from the instantiation
of the Mastermind object, breaking down the corresponding 
sets of columns into blocks of values that would equal the
same value as to ensure that all possibilities are covered.
This is much like the creation of a truth table.
